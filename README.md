## Projects

### 1: Comparing the Efficacy of 2 Machine Learning Stock Predictors

**Description:**
‚Ä¢ Developing a Python machine learning model to predict movements in securities pricing
‚Ä¢ Developing a trading simulation in C++ to track the efficacy of the model.
‚Ä¢ Coding in Python and the Scikit-learn library (Random Forest Generator) for one model.
‚Ä¢ Coding with Pytorch developing a stock price forecaster using a Recurrent Neural Network: LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for the other model.
‚Ä¢ Training both models on the same dataset of daily AMZN price history and comparing output in terms of Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-squared (R¬≤) value.
‚Ä¢ Planning integration of pre-trained Large Language Models from the Hugging Face repository for news feed price predictions.

**Technologies used:**
- Python: Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Pytorch
- C++
